# Programming Concepts: 
    • Functional programming: Clojure, immutable data, first-class functions
    • Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    • Typing: Strong vs. weak, strict typing
    • Homoiconicity in programming languages
    • Common Language Runtime (CLR) and Common Intermediate Language (CIL)

# Technologies & Frameworks: 
    • ASP.NET and its evolution
    • .NET Framework history and versions
    • Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
    • SignalR for real-time ASP.NET
    • Visual J++, Perl.NET

# Programming Practices: 
    • Test-driven development (writing tests before code)
    • Code refactoring
    • Kent Beck's four rules of simple design
    • CamelCase and PascalCase naming conventions

# Notable People Mentioned: 
    • Scott Guthrie (replacement for ASP)
    • David Fowler and Damien Edwards (SignalR creators)
    • Kent Beck (Extreme Programming)

# Learning Resources: 
    • Microsoft Learn courses
    • Mastering Development Tools course
    • The Twelve-Factor App methodology (12factor.net)

# Additional Concepts: 
    • DevOps
    • Domain Driven Design
    • Algorithms and data structures (e.g., Linked List, Stack)
    • API calls
    • Black box theory
    • Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection
